            <h2>Research Background</h2>
            <p>During my academic tenure, I developed a deep passion for research, especially with regards to optimizing nitrogen fertilization for enhanced crop yield and sustainability using biodegradable products within the master's program. My interest was further solidified through my involvement in working with the Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada-Brandon Research and Development Center where I developed R skills and passion towards research. Through this connection, I was able to develop both field and laboratory skills working with greenhouse gas instruments. The studious professors at Brandon University directed my interest towards working on sustainability and working towards a brighter future.</p>

            <p>An incubation experiment was conducted at the greenhouse within Brandon University to test the biodegradability status of polymer-coated urea under optimal conditions. Soil surveys were also conducted across Manitoba to determine the rate of biodegradation of the polymer-coating in the natural environment. These two assessments of polymer-coating degradation are used to bridge the knowledge gap of polymer-based biodegradation within Manitoban soils. Additionally, the redistribution of the polymer-coatings was manually sampled around tillage, surface runoff, and wind erosion events to assess any transport from the agroecosystem. The rigorous testing of polymer-coating biodegradation across chronological and spatial dimensions demonstrates my dedication, focus, and potential to contribute towards future research opportunities.</p>
