            <h2>Pedagogical Framework</h2>
            <p>I believe that both teachers and students must embrace lifelong learning. Educators should exemplify the qualities they seek to instill in their students, including a dedication to continous personal and professional developement. As students often model the behaviors of their teachers, educators demonstrate passionate, reflection, and a commitment to growth will naturally inspire these qualities in their students. The primary goals of assessment is to nuture independent, lifelong learners who regularly engage in self-reflection and progression monitoring (Manitoba Education and Youth, 2003). Mistakes are an inherent part of the learning journey, and I strive to create a supportive environment where students feel empowered to take risks, ask questions, and learn from setbacks. By weighting assignments as the predmoninant factor in grading  offering opportunities for revision, students are able to demonstrate mastery over time rather than through rote memorization. Formative assessments serve as valuable checkpoints in the learning journey, enabling educators to adjust their approach and enhance the overall student learning experience.</p>

            <p>In Manitoba, educators should empower students to take ownership of their assessments. The focus of education should shift away from memorization and towards fostering metacognitive skills. Skills that enable students to monitor their own learning and make adjustments when necessary (Cookson, 2009). This approach underscores that meaningful learning and improvement stems from gradual, incremental progress, rather than achieving a fixed score. Allowing students to revise previous assignments provides an opportunity to showcase their grwoth and deepened understanding, rather than limit their success from a single assessment outcome. Ultimately, learning is not defined by where students begin their learning journey, but by how they persevere and progress. I encourage students to measure their achievements by reflecting on their past performances, rather than comparing themselves to others. By nuruting a strong work ethic and resilience, students will continually surpass their previous milestones, building self-confidence and cultivating an intrinsic sense of motivation.</p>
