            <h2>Teaching Profile</h2>
            <p>I have had the privilege of working with students who struggled with mathematics, and I was able to support them throughout their learning journey. Teachers who demonstrate unwavering dedication and a willingness to make sacrifices for their students often become the ones students truly cherish (Duncan-Andrade, 2009). One student, in particular, embodied this idea. When I began my student teaching placement, this student was failing. However, through consistent support and working closely together every day during their lunch break, we were able to significantly improve their grades. What started as a collaborative effort between us became a shared hourney of dedication and perseverance, having both of us committed to reaching success. On a feedback evaluation, this student expressed their gratitude for the extra help they received, sugessting that I continue to provide additional supports to others. While my time with this student was brief, the experience had a lasting impact on both their academic and personal growth. This experience encapsulates my vision of what a teacher should strive to be- someone who makes a meaningful difference, no matter how small, by showing dedication, patience, and genuine care for studentsâ€™ development.</p>
